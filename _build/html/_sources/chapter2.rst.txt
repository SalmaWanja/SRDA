============================================

SELECTTION OF REPORT ATTRIBUTES
-------------------------------
On the far left of the new page, there is an area where the user can select all the atttributes they wish to be included in the report.
The types of attributes that are expected include:
                                                    -*Indicators*

                                                    -*Data Elements*

                                                    -*Data Sets*

                                                    -*Organization Units*
                                                    

The selected metadata is what will be used to create tables and charts for visualization. A list of whatever is selected will be displayed on the right side.
